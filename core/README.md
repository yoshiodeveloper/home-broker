# Core

The core package holds all interfaces and implementation used by all other packages.

## DB

Common features for databases handlers. Ex: Open and Close connections.

Each database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.) should implement these features (methods).

Implementations should be in "implem" subdirectory.
